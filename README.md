# Pedestrian_tracking_using_Lidar
ROS2 project to track and count the number of pedestrians encountered in Lidar Point Cloud data

STARTING TASK CHECKLIST:
1. Explore Launch files and Bags in Ros2
2. Explore Rviz2
3. Understand which tracking algorithm to  use
4. Design the problem with at least 2 nodes

TASK for Oct 17, 2023- All 3 of us are going to check the following and keep on adding tutorial links:
1. Launch
   a. https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Launch-Main.html  - Managing Large project explains how to launch rviz from launch files to visualize
   b. https://design.ros2.org/articles/roslaunch.html 
2. Bags
   a. https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Recording-A-Bag-From-Your-Own-Node-Py.html - writing to bag
   b. https://mcap.dev/guides/python/ros2 - Reading and writing from bags
   c. https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-bag-save-and-replay-topic-data/ - replaying topic data saved in bag file (only helpful for initial understanding)
4. Rviz2
   a. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNd-ZqWKsBc - rviz2 but with gazebo. We can filter out the rviz2 portions -LOL watched the same one


How to plot bag data

cd <your bag folder>
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2


Change Global Status -> Fixed frame -> world
Add -> LaserScan -> Topic -> /scan

Open a new terminal <probably same folder>
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 bag play example9.db3
